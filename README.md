## 🧠 What is VoidChan?

VoidChan is a **modern reimagining of old-school imageboards** like 4chan, where users freely explore boards, share thoughts, play browser games, and dive into random topics without the noise of modern social media.

Built entirely from scratch by **KarlDev (2025)**, VoidChan mixes nostalgia with innovation — a colorful, fast, and dynamic web experience for anyone who loves open forums and the wild side of the internet.
